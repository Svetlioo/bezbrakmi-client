# BezBrakmi Client - Frontend

BezBrakmi Client is the frontend part of a web application that aims to revolutionize the car browsing experience. It is inspired by the features of Cars.bg and Mobile.bg, but with added functionality and a superior user experience.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- React with Vite
- TypeScript
- CSS Modules
- React Router
- React Query (planned for future implementation)
- React Redux with Redux Toolkit (planned for future implementation)
- React Hook Form with Yup (planned for future implementation)

### Backend

- Java 21
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL

## Features

- Enhanced Design: The application boasts a modern and intuitive design, providing a seamless user experience. Currently, it is quite similar to the design of Cars.bg.
- Improved Search and Filter Functionality: Users can easily search and filter through the car listings based on various parameters, making the car browsing process more efficient.
- Comprehensive Solution: The platform offers a comprehensive solution for users seeking an upgraded and feature-rich car browsing experience.

## Limitations of Alternatives (Cars.bg and Mobile.bg)

- Limited Search Options: Cars.bg and Mobile.bg lack the ability to search for precise horsepower, multiple colors, multiple transmissions and many other combinations that I personally wanted to search for myself, but were not available.
- Inefficient Filtering: The filtering options in Cars.bg and Mobile.bg are limited and do not provide enough choices to refine the car search based on specific criteria.

## Future Features (In Development)

- Dark Mode: The application will include a dark mode option, allowing users to switch to a darker color scheme for improved visibility in low-light environments.
- Expanded Filter Options: Additional filters will be added, giving users more choices to refine their car search based on specific criteria.
- Location-based Sorting: A new feature will be introduced that allows users to sort the car listings based on their proximity to the car's location, making it easier to find cars that are closer to them.
- And many more features that will enhance the car browsing experience and provide a comprehensive solution for users.
